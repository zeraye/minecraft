# Minecraft

Minecraft clone written in golang highly inspired from [Javidx9](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder)'s project [Engine3D](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/Javidx9/tree/master/ConsoleGameEngine/BiggerProjects/Engine3D).

## Development

Currently this project doesn't look like "Minecraft clone", because it's work in progress. Now it's more like 3d game engine. In the future this project will look much more similar to the well know game.
